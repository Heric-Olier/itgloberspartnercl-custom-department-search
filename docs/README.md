## Description

The Department Search component is a block that renders a department search bar. It is a simple search bar that allows users to search for products by department.

## Configuration 

1. Add the Custom Department Search app to your theme's dependencies in the manifest.json, for example:
```json
  dependencies: {
    "{vendor}.custom-department-search": "0.x"
  }
 ```
 
2. install node modules, go to `react` folder and run `yarn`
 
3. Add the `department-search` block to your store-theme, for example:
```json
 {
  "flex-layout.col#search__by--department": {
    "title": "search by department",
    "children": [
      "flex-layout.col#title__search--by--department",
      "department-search"
    ],
    "props": {
      "blockClass": "search__by--department--col"
    }
  },
 }
   ```

   Block name      | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `department-search` | ![https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red)  This is the top-level block that must be declared in a `store-theme` block to render the department search   |
